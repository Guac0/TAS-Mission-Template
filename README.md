# TAS Mission Template
 
See documentation in Eden (comment modules). You can customize and disable the various scripts by looking at initServer.sqf, there is no need to delete files to disable scripts unless specifically stated.

Ignore the outdated mission file. 

For more information on a specific script, open its files and look at the comments there. Some documentation may be missing or outdated, ask Guac if you have questions.
